We have implemented prophet to predict the real-time daily sales and purchases figure for each item through time series forecasting

'Prophet.ipynb' contains charts, diagrams and extra implementation of holidays

'sales_loop.ipynb' generates daily sales figure in 'sales_predict.xlsx' which is in turn used to generate 'SPU_optimized_orders.xlsx' 
with 'SKU_SPU.ipynb' which shows how much each restaurant should be ordering per day to minimise wastage

'purchase_loop.ipynb' generates daily purchase order placements according to the chef's decisions which is used in 'Answer Sheet.xlsx'
